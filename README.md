# P1-Autonomous-Car
A project we did during the first year in the engineering program. An ambitious attempt to create a small autonomous vehicle - which almost worked!

Interesting code:
	- AndroidClient/
		app/
			src/

	- arduino-embedded/
		CarController/

	- raspberrypi-embedded/
		* AndroidComms.py
		* AutoCommunication.py
		* stream_video.py
		* ultrasonic_client.py

	- server/
		* collect_train_data_socket.py
		* mlp_predict_test.py
		* mlp_training.py
		* picam_calibration.py
		* rc_driver.py
